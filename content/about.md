Jiabao Ji is a first-year Ph.D. student at UCSB advised by [Prof. Shiyu Chang](https://code-terminator.github.io).

Before that, he obtained B.S. in Computer Science at [ACM class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He was a research assistant in [X-Lance Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en) supervised by [Prof. Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu) and [Prof. Lu Chen](https://coai-sjtu.github.io). He did a remote internship at [SLS Lab](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/), advised by [Prof. James Glass](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/people/glass.shtml) and [Dr. Tianxing He](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cloudygoose/).

Currently, he is working on text-to-image diffusion models and large langauge models.

## Misc
I was a KDE+archlinux user with good animation and enormous amount of apps brought by pacman. But I changed to MacOS for more stable environment :( 

I started to use Vim and tiling window manager like i3/dwm/amethyst recently.

I like many sports. I'm a fan of Leo Messi, Derrick Rose, Tadej Pogačar.\
I like sci-fi movies and sci-fi books.
